### What's this?
If you ever wanted to exclude a post comments to be displayed into `Recent Comments` widget, look no more! This awesome plugin will allow to do exactly this. After enabling the plugin, look into post edit sidebar metaboxes and you'll find a neat little checkbox that will control if the post is excluded or not.

### It is compatible with Gutenberg?
Don't be silly, of course it is! This plugin will work great, either you're a Gutenberg or a Classic (TinyMCE) user!
